### User Stories Completed

* As a host I want to skip a song in case it's something nobody really wants to listen to.
* As a user I want a private key, so that only people I know can join the room.
* As a user I want to see upcoming songs, so we can plan our playlist additions accordingly.
* As a user I want to add a song to the playlist using my mobile device, so that I can contribute to the party soundtrack.
* As a user I want to see previously played songs, so I can remember a song for later.
* As a user I want to see accompanying and related background video for the song, so that I can get some visual stimulation.
* As a host I want duplicate songs to be rejected, so that we don't get multiple plays of the same song in a row.

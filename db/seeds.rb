# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# room = Room.create
# room.songs.create(name: "Halo", artist: "Beyonce", length: 261.085, spotify_url: "4JehYebiI9JE8sR8MisGVb")
# room.songs.create(name: "Get Lucky", artist: "Daft Punk", length: 369.626, spotify_url: "69kOkLUCkxIZYexIgSG8rq")
